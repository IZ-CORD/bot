## WHAT DATA DO WE STORE??
We will not collect any personal information relating to the account you use such as password, credentials and other personal information.

These data are necessary for the proper functioning of IZONE Discord bot in the use of certain features such as providing user avatars, user ID will be stored when the user is blacklisted on IZONE Discord bot, channel and server information, and others. Without this data, IZONE discord bot would not be able to perform this activity and thus now the included features cannot be used by other users.
